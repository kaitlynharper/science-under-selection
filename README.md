This repository will hold an agent-based model of academia developed to explore the balance between original and replication research with insights from evolutionary dynamics. It is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the priority programme META-REP, which investigates replicability and reform in scientific research.
